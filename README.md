# AlgorithmStudio

Algorithm Visualization Tool bulit for better understanding of algorithms.
Implemented Path finding and Sorting Algorithms.
Live app- http://algorithm-studio.herokuapp.com/
# Usage
* On the home page click on a thumbnail to open its page.
* For Path-Finding Algos
  * First two clicks on grid will select source and destination respectively.
  * All the clicks thereafter will mark cells as obstacles
  * Click on start button - You will see BFS algo searching for source
* For Sorting Algos
  * Drag the Size slider to adjust no of elements in array
  * After the array is sorted you can drag the Timeline slider to see a specific step

Step Buttons can be used for more precise control in Sorting Algorithms. Instead of dragging the size slider, the application will also accept custom input(values above 40 are ignored, as bars will be too long to fit on screen).
